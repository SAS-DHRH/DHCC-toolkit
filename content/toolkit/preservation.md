# Preservation and Archiving

“A place to begin this navigation is recognizing that heritage is an anchor: a lifeline that grounds us and provides security and connection in the midst of change. Heritage creates sense of community and attachment to place, which promote disaster recovery and collective action.”
— A.R. Siders and Marcy Rockman {{< /hint >}}

Sustainable preservation and archiving starts with responsible **creation and collection**. Put simply, you should not create or collect anything without some consideration of your responsibilities and resources in sustaining it.

It is important to take responsibility for actively disposing of data and resources (such as project websites) at the end of a project and/or the retention period set by funding bodies. This responsibility goes beyond any commitments made to research participants to dispose of their data after a given time period.

Disposal won't always mean immediate deletion. You may choose to hand over responsibility for data and resources to a **steward**, such as an academic publisher (in the case of journal outputs), a web archive (in the case of websites), a cultural heritage organisation, or another form of research data repository. You may wish to open up dialogue with potential stewards around climate.

Such dialogue can also help to clarify what kind of commitment they are making towards it. How long will they keep it? How will they make it available? What are their own motives and constraints in doing so, and how might these change? It may also involve more technical aspects. For instance, [Pendergrass et. al (2019)](https://doi.org/10.17723/0360-9081-82.1.165) suggest **scheduling** high-energy and high-bandwidth activities at off-peak times:

> As many of the energy- and bandwidth-intensive tasks of digital preservation are scheduled events, the barriers to shifting to off-peak use are fairly low. For example, instead of running fixity checks or transferring large amounts of data over the network during the day, scheduling these tasks to run overnight takes advantage of times when both electricity and bandwidth demand are low. [(Pendergrass et. al 2019)](https://doi.org/10.17723/0360-9081-82.1.165)

Data can be stored more sustainably by keeping it **offline or “nearline”** (meaning it is not available immediately, but can be made available with little or no human intervention). Sustainable preservation means considering offline storage or nearline storage. [Kilbride (2021)](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/digital-preservation-and-climate-change-provocation-to-and-from-cop26) comments:

> [...] every touchpoint of a preservation workflow requires some energy – ingest, fixity check, migration and access for example. So as well as reducing the data volumes we need to ask how many times a file needs to checked for integrity. We need to question the assumption of large-scale format migration and normalization, and the carbon cost of storing and processing uncompressed files. We need to ask whether instant access – which means spinning disks – is always the best solution. Nearline or offline storage is less good for users but is much healthier for the planet. [(Kilbride 2021)](https://www.dpconline.org/blog/digital-preservation-and-climate-change-provocation-to-and-from-cop26)

A recent white paper by Fuji is enthusiastic about nearline / offline storage using tape:

> Tape supports green datacenter initiatives by storing data offline without consuming energy. Tape systems can also serve as nearline or active-archive tiers of storage. This means that the data is available for productive use but does not consume processing power and requires minimal environmental resources while the data is not being used. [(Cooke et al. 2021)](https://asset.fujifilm.com/master/americas/files/2021-10/5c4e59187b7c6d5edb8c8e2bc1078fe8/IDC-Fujifilm-green-DC-WP_092421.pdf)

The **potential curation** of preserved data should also be weighed up, especially since these may be relevant to sustainability. Collections can help to raise awareness and foster debate about climate justice. There is widespread recognition that climate transition needs to be more participatory and democratic than is currently the case. ‘Additional activities in the process of heritage interpretation are restoration, documentation and revitalisation of tangible and intangible cultural heritage. The volunteering activities imbue strong principles of democracy, equality, tolerance, nondiscrimination and inclusiveness for every participant’ [(Interpret Europe 2020)](https://www.interpret-europe.net/fileadmin/Documents/publications/interpret_europe_fostering_communities_through_heritage_interpretation_v28-05-2020.pdf) Collections can play a role in cultural heritage institutions acting as trusted spaces where publics form, get informed, enthused, and empowered. Furthermore, collections can help with mainstreaming climate awareness across diverse domains. That is, curators can include climate change and climate justice angles, even when the climate is not the primary focus of a particular programme, exhibition, or event. Some resources include:

* [Climate Heritage Network](https://climateheritage.org/)
* [European Association for Heritage Interpretation](https://interpret-europe.net/about-heritage-interpretation/)
* [International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property](https://ocm.iccrom.org/)
* [Indigenous Archives Collective](https://indigenousarchives.net/)

Quantifying the **financial costs** of sustainable stewardship is difficult, although tools such as [Curation Costs Exchange](https://www.curationexchange.org/)[Total Cost of Stewardship](https://www.oclc.org/research/publications/2021/oclcresearch-total-cost-of-stewardship.html), and [Costing (UK Data Service)](https://ukdataservice.ac.uk/learning-hub/research-data-management/plan-to-share/costing/) can help. Making a financial contribution towards ongoing upkeep is not typically costed within research funding applications, but there is perhaps an argument that it should be. Alternatively, a contribution could be made in terms of working with the steward to reduce the cost to them of ‘taking on’ your material. This may involve your taking on the tasks of re-formatting the material, weeding out duplicate or unimportant material, and/or creating additional documentation to ensure that what remains is reusable by others.

If you are passing on the outputs of your work to a different steward (or repository) from the one who was caring for the data on which that work was based, you could also consider contacting the original steward to let them know. This would allow them to realise some of the added benefit that has arisen from their part in your work.
