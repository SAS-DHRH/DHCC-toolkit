<a class=anchor href=#project-planning>#</a></h1><p>Our research cultures won&rsquo;t change by themselves. We have to make it
happen. Planning our research responsibly now, rather than waiting for
funders to require environmental statements, means that we are modelling
the change we want to see in the world.</p><h2 id=funding-landscape>Funding Landscape
<a class=anchor href=#funding-landscape>#</a></h2><p>Currently this section and the next (Data Management Plans) focuses on
the UK context. We would like to broaden this. <strong>We invite funders and
researchers across Europe and globally to contribute their
perspectives</strong>, to widen the scope of this section (we hope this will be
one focus of our first toolkit workshop, at DH Benelux in June 2022).</p><p>Within the UK context, in mid 2022, our view is that:</p><ul><li>The funding landscape is likely to change, and researchers should collaborate proactively with funding bodies to co-produce the next generation of funding allocation mechanisms.</li><li>In the meanwhile, there is plenty of scope within existing funding application frameworks to propose sustainable research. For example, the Data Management Plan section of UKRI applications can be used to reflect on digital carbon and wider sustainability and justice issues.</li><li>Funders have signalled that they are open to existing frameworks and guidance being interpreted in this way. The authors of this toolkit welcome this, and invite funders to actively signal the direction of travel and the interim arrangements (especially to peer reviewers).</li></ul><p>The funding landscape is at a moment of transition. The UK has declared
a climate emergency, as have universities and research organisations
across the sector. The major research funding bodies have signalled that
decarbonisation, sustainability, and just climate transition are top
priorities. Use of Information Communications Technology (ICT) is widely
recognised as <a href=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100340>a major source of carbon
emissions</a>.</p><p>We need, urgently, to &lsquo;green&rsquo; our research. However, most of the major
funders do not yet explicitly ask applicants about the sustainability or
climate justice dimensions of their projects. The current major UK
exception is the Wellcome Trust. Funders are exploring how they can
drive sustainability in research project design; however, revisions to
application processes take time. This is partly because of justifiable
concern not to make application processes unnecessarily onerous
(increasing the amount of work that goes into funding applications can
have its own implications for equity and justice within the academy).</p><p>The Digital Humanities Climate Coalition supports the revision of
funding processes to centre sustainability and climate justice. We also
argue, however, that existing application frameworks and guidance do
<em>implicitly</em> ask for reflection on sustainability and climate justice.</p><h2 id=DMP>Data Management Plans
<a class=anchor href=#DMP>#</a></h2><p>In this section we focus on UKRI Standard Grants (we hope to expand this
scope in the future, and would be interested to hear from collaborators,
especially across Europe). One area of special interest for this toolkit
is the UKRI&rsquo;s Data Management Plan (DMP). There are also opportunities
to include information of this kind in the Ethics, Case for Support, and
Justification of Resource sections. A DMP outlines a project&rsquo;s approach
to managing data through a response to a series of prompts on data
creation, storage, sharing, and ethics, which are provided in the
application guidance. UKRI guidance also points researchers to resources
they might find useful in preparing a DMP and encourages applicants to
demonstrate knowledge of institutional policies and procedures. Some
grant writers find the DMP useful since it tends to focus one on the
minute material detail of the research process (exactly what data will
be created, by whom, when, etc.). However, the DMP is sometimes handled
by specialists who may not be closely involved in the project, and/or
via templates or text that is copy-pasted and lightly edited.</p><p>Neither the <a href=https://www.ukri.org/publications/ahrc-research-funding-guide/>DMP application guidance nor its associated assessment
criteria</a>
currently explicitly refer to the climate crisis or environmental
emergency. However, funders have indicated an openness to researchers
proactively interpreting existing DMP guidance for sustainability and
climate justice. Reading <strong>DMP guidance</strong> (e.g. in the <a href=https://www.ukri.org/publications/ahrc-research-funding-guide/>AHRC Funding
Guide</a>)
from a <strong>climate justice perspective</strong> makes it clear that its prompts
are worded with sufficient openness that they enable researchers to
respond in ways which align with sectoral and national climate
commitments.</p><p>Five areas can be immediately considered when writing a DMP:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Energy proportionality</strong>. In the Royal Society&rsquo;s report <a href=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/digital-technology-and-the-planet/>Digital Technology and the Planet</a> (2020), a key principle of the chapter on Green Computing is &rsquo;energy proportionality&rsquo;. For a researcher writing a climate justice-oriented DMP, the imperative here is not to produce numbers that show their anticipated energy use per month by some measure. Rather it is to demonstrate that the research design seeks to ensure that the resources used (e.g. hardware purchases, compute time, data storage) will be proportional to the results produced (e.g. outputs, anticipated findings, impacts). <a href=https://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/>Minimal Computing</a> approaches may be useful.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource proliferation</strong>. A key finding of The Shift Project&rsquo;s report <a href=https://theshiftproject.org/en/lean-ict-2/>Lean ICT: Towards Digital Sobriety</a> (2019) is that increasing the lifetime of professional laptops from 3 to 5 years could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 37%. Equally, recent and important long form studies like Kate Crawford&rsquo;s <a href=https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300209570/atlas-ai><em>Atlas of AI</em></a> (2021) have underscored the ecological impacts of device proliferation. For a researcher writing a climate justice-oriented DMP, the imperative here is to justify the environmental costs of new device purchases, to demonstrate alignment with institutional policies on device recycling (e.g. does your institution follow or go beyond <a href=https://ec.europa.eu/environment/topics/waste-and-recycling/waste-electrical-and-electronic-equipment-weee_en>Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)</a> regulations in their approach), and to consider and explain the benefits of using refurbished devices if appropriate. For example, if external hard drives purchased for a previous project and pooled by your research group are serviceable and within warranty, they may be perfectly usable for a future project that seeks to take a climate justice-oriented approach to data management, and can be described as such in your DMP.</p></li><li><p><strong>Computationally intensive research</strong>. Computer time requires energy use. Lannelongue, Greanley, and Inouye give us tools to
calculate this in their 2020 paper &lsquo;<a href=https://doi.org/10.1002/advs.202100707>Green Algorithms: Quantifying the Carbon Footprint of Computation</a>&rsquo;. In turn their <a href=http://www.green-algorithms.org/>&lsquo;Green Algorithms&rsquo; service</a> gives us an interactive way to understand this energy use relative to driving a car, taking a flight, or planting trees, a way &ndash; in short &ndash; of describing energy proportionality. For a researcher writing a climate justice-oriented DMP, the imperative here is to describe the decisions taken about the purchase of storage and storage services that relate to and overlap with computationally intensive research activities. For example, that the energy source mix for cloud providers have been investigated, or that data will be structured and stored in ways that reduce compute time and the need for brute force approaches.</p></li><li><p><strong>Where measurement is challenging, err on the side of caution</strong>. Good quantitative data on environmental impacts can be hard to come by. Building capacity in this area is important. However, don&rsquo;t be shy to make choices that appear more sustainable to you, even if their positive contribution is not quantified.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identifying relevant standards, frameworks, and guidelines</strong>. There are by now many resources that support climate justice across many different aspects of project management. These range from guidelines to minimise the carbon footprint of events, to standards for stakeholder mapping and engagement, to database tools for estimating the carbon intensity of procurement decisions. There are also institution-level standards with project-level relevance (e.g. the <a href=https://sciencebasedtargets.org/>Science Based Targets initiative</a>, often referred to as SBTi). These all involve some form of data collection and management, and as such, the DMP is an appropriate place to include them.</p></li></ol><p>These considerations fit within existing guidance. For example, the prompt that asks whether there are &lsquo;any legal and ethical considerations of collecting the data&rsquo; (p. 56) raises the possibility of discussing the ethics of over-producing data that need energy and resources to be stored. Similarly, answers to the question &lsquo;How long will <em>the data</em> be stored for and why?&rsquo; (p. 56) might reasonably balance long-term preservation of research outputs with the imperative to reduce the proliferation of data on public facing services that are unused for long periods. Finally, the requirement that the applicant and their institution have &lsquo;considered all the risks, and storage will be in line with the institution&rsquo;s data management policy&rsquo; prompts reflection on long-term data storage, the adaptations to climate change required to ensure long-term storage, and the entanglement of institutional data management policies with environmental strategies.</p><p>We recognise that not all researchers will have the knowledge and expertise to develop these lines of thinking and to make informed
decisions. We are also mindful that researchers may wish to &ldquo;play it safe&rdquo; and not risk a bid by including climate justice-oriented practice
that may be new to them. However, the <a href=https://www.ipcc.ch/2022/04/04/ipcc-ar6-wgiii-pressrelease/>scientific advice is clear</a> that there is an imperative to act immediately.</p><p>We hope this short guide will enable researchers to be bold in
interpreting the DMP guidance, rather than seeing climate
justice-oriented actions as another box to tick. Climate
justice-oriented data management practices can be threaded through the research programmes of all researchers applying for UKRI funding. There is nothing stopping us apart from developing our knowledge so we can define the appropriate actions to take.</p><blockquote class="book-hint warning"><strong>Suggested DMP Citation:</strong> Researchers who have referred to this guidance in developing a DMP may optionally include wording such as, <em>&ldquo;This DMP is aligned with Digital Humanities Climate Coalition&rsquo;s 2022 recommendations on data management and climate justice.&rdquo;</em></blockquote><h2 id=project-footprinting>Should you footprint your project?
<a class=anchor href=#project-footprinting>#</a></h2><blockquote class="book-hint info"><p><em>&ldquo;To give just one example, did you know that the very notion of a personal carbon footprint &mdash; a concept that&rsquo;s completely ubiquitous in discussions about personal responsibility &mdash; was first popularized by BP as part of a $100 million per year marketing campaign between 2004
and 2006?&rdquo;</em></p><p><a href=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/09/oil-companies-discourage-climate-action-study-says/>Tracing Big Oil&rsquo;s PR war to delay action on climate
change</a>,
<em>Harvard Gazette</em>, Geoffrey Supran, Sept 2021 (Accessed 4 April
2022)</p></blockquote><p>It is not our responsibility, nor our priority, to directly measure the carbon impact of our research. Often we won&rsquo;t even need to make precise estimates. However, we do all urgently need to develop a degree of <strong>carbon literacy,</strong> and carrying out footprinting exercises can be one great way to learn. Labos 1point5&rsquo;s <a href=https:/labos1point5.org/ges-1point5>GES1point5</a> and the <a href=https:/www.thoughtworks.com/insights/podcasts/pragmatism-in-practice/green-cloud-optimization>Thoughtworks</a> <a href=https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/docs/aws>Cloud Carbon Footprint</a> are examples of carbon footprinting tools (for labs and for cloud usage respectively); the GHG Protocol also offers <a href=https://ghgprotocol.org/ghg-emissions-calculation-tool>various tools</a>.</p><p>The desire for precise data can sometimes be counterproductive. Rough qualitative understandings are often enough to help us make sustainable decisions. Decisions that may initially require research can become fast, easy and intuitive over time. &ldquo;Is doing it this way more or less carbon intensive than doing it that way? Are they in the same ballpark, or completely different orders of magnitude? Is the intuitive approach OK here, or do we need to assess this more rigorously?&rdquo;</p><p>One useful concept here is Emissions Factors (EF). Put in simple terms, an EF gives a sense of how carbon intensive something usually is. The IPCC maintains a <a href=https://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php>database of EFs</a>. In the UK, the Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy provide
<a href=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/greenhouse-gas-reporting-conversion-factors-2021>spreadsheets</a> which include Emission Factors. By multiplying the values listed there with your own &ldquo;activity data&rdquo; (for example, financial spend, or miles travelled in a car, or tonnes of plastic waste disposed, etc.) you can generate an estimate of the carbon impact.</p><p>However, definitive EFs are often not available for the type of activities that, as researchers using digital tools, we may want to know about. Thoughtworks&rsquo;s Cloud Carbon Footprint estimates emissions based on data centre billing data in four usage categories: Compute, Storage, Networking and Memory (RAM). It is partly based on Etsy&rsquo;s EFs (called the <a href=https://github.com/etsy/cloud-jewels>Cloud Jewels</a>).</p><h2 id=travel>Travel
<a class=anchor href=#travel>#</a></h2><p>Conferences, workshops, sandpits, seminars, events, meetings, fieldwork. Videoconferencing, teleworking. What should be done in person, and what should be done remotely? What digital tools facilitate sustainable ways
of working, and what are their drawbacks or risks? This is a huge topic, and we won&rsquo;t try to cover everything here.
